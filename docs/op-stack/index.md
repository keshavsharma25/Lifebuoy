# OP Stack

OP Stack is one of the most successful open source modular frameworks built
by Optimism to help scale Ethereum. After a lot of research and iterations
with OVM (Optimism Virtual Machine), the organization eventually created
the most adopted stack in the rollup ecosystem as of today.

[Announced](https://www.optimism.io/blog/introducing-the-op-stack) in 2022, Optimism Foundation's OP Mainnet transitioned
from OVM (EVM-in-EVM) implementation to the OP Stack via
[Bedrock upgrade](https://www.optimism.io/blog/introducing-bedrock) in June, 2023. This upgrade was one of the most
anticipated milestones for the foundation and a quintessential framework for
others to deploy their own customized rollups.

The vision of Superchain envisioned by Optimism with this rollup stack has
been quite successful. The likes of Base (Coinbase), Unichain (Uniswap),
Ink (Kraken Exchange), World Chain (world.org), and Soneium (Sony) all using
their stack.
