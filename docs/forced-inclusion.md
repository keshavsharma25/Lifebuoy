# Forced Inclusion

Rollups are judged based on various security parameters. One such parameter is
a guarantee to users that they control their assets at all times. No user should
be obliged to trust a centralized sequencer with their assets and can voluntarily
exit their assets back to L1 anytime. Force inclusions or escape hatches are one
such feature that provides an assurance that their assets are safe and can be
withdrawn to their wish (and not by any centralized sequencer).
