# Sequencers: The Protagonist & The Antagonist

Sequencers are notoriously accused of doing the bad things behind the back of users
with no way to verify their honesty. They are often seen being cursed left right
and center even when everything is hunky dory in the rollup
land (NOT - stage 2 wen?).

Primary reason being, sequencers introduce a lot of trust issues with them.
And trust & decentralization are often the far end pieces of a spectrum.
The sheer possibility of someone telling you - "Trust me bro!" should ring
bells in your ear. Similarly, sequencers aren't criticized for their doings
because they haven't done anything suspicious but are yelled at due to just
some possibility of such mishap happening.

It is quite aspirational and easy to make promises. And Stage 2 seems to be one such promise.

The role of sequencer, in principle is to include transactions submitted by users and order them
based on the maximum MEV earned to distribute it back to the community either via governance or
grants. But the problem lies in the implementation.
